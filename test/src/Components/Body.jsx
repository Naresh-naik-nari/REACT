                    Coconut Ven Pongal Recipe I first tasted this Coconut Pongal at a wedding in Chennai. It was incredibly soft and melted in the mouth like butter. However, it was quite bland, served alongside a spicy black pepper kolambu. Inspired by that, I decided to make it slightly spicier and paired it with Miriyala Pappucharu (Pepper Dal)â€”a combination that turned out to be a super hit! My method remains simple, just as I had in Chennai, but with an extra punch of flavor.
